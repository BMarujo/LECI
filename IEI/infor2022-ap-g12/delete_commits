HOW TO DELETE COMMITS:


git checkout branch_name 

//if I want to delete from main branch and I am already there don't need that command



git rebase -i HEAD~5

//show last 5 commits (in current branch)
//replace pick with drop for the commits I wish to delete



git rebase --continue

//(if needed)



git push origin branch_name --force

//delete commits from remote repository aswell
//if in branch main -> git push origin main --force
