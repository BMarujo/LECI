# SUMMARY:

### Introduction
- **Problem**: Programming complex robot skills is challenging and typically requires expert knowledge.
- **Solution**: Utilize human sensorimotor learning to intuitively control robots and derive autonomous controllers from human performance.

### HL-RSS Paradigm
- **Concept**: Humans control a robot as a tool, learning to perform tasks using the robot. This learning process is similar to learning to drive a car.
- **Phases**:
  1. **Human Training Phase**: A human controls the robot via an intuitive interface and becomes proficient in the task.
  2. **Autonomous Controller Phase**: The skilled human performance data is used to train a machine learning algorithm to develop an autonomous controller for the robot.

### Balanced Reaching Skill
- **Objective**: Equip a humanoid robot with the ability to reach targets using its hand without falling.
- **Method**: 
  - Use a small humanoid robot (Fujitsu HOAP-II) with 25 rotational joints.
  - The human operator learns to control the robot's movements while maintaining stability.
- **Results**: Successful demonstration of statically stable reaching skill, showing that the robot could maintain balance while performing the task at low speeds.

### Dynamic Posture Control
- **Objective**: Investigate the human ability to control dynamic tasks, such as maintaining the vertical balance of an inverted pendulum.
- **Method**:
  - Compare visual and proprioceptive-vestibular feedback in controlling an inverted pendulum.
  - Construct a Stewart platform to provide proprioceptive-vestibular feedback, allowing the human to feel and respond to the robot's balance requirements naturally.
- **Results**: 
  - Visual feedback alone was sufficient for static tasks.
  - Proprioceptive-vestibular feedback provided better performance for dynamic tasks, aligning human motor responses with robot control needs.

### Conclusion
- **HL-RSS Paradigm**: Demonstrated effective for both static and dynamic tasks, reducing the need for expert programming.
- **Future Work**: Explore more complex tasks and improve feedback interfaces to enhance human learning and robot performance.

This paper highlights the potential of using human sensorimotor capabilities to simplify the development of autonomous robot skills, making advanced robotics more accessible and efficient.

**Script:**
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Thank you for being here today. My name is [Your Name], and I will be presenting on 'Human Sensorimotor Learning for Humanoid Robot Skill Synthesis.' This presentation will explore how we can leverage human sensorimotor learning to develop autonomous behaviors in humanoid robots. Let's dive in."

### Slide 2: Introduction
**Script:**
"Programming complex skills in robots is a challenging task that typically requires significant expertise and time. The objective of our research is to simplify this process by utilizing human sensorimotor learning. By doing so, we aim to develop autonomous robot behaviors more intuitively and efficiently."

### Slide 3: HL-RSS Paradigm
**Script:**
"Our approach is called Human Learning for Robot Skill Synthesis, or HL-RSS. The concept is straightforward: humans control a robot as a tool, learning to perform tasks using the robot. This process is divided into two phases: the Human Training Phase, where a human operator learns to control the robot, and the Autonomous Controller Phase, where the performance data from the human is used to train a machine learning algorithm to develop an autonomous controller."

### Slide 4: Balanced Reaching Skill Experiment - Objective and Setup
**Script:**
"The first experiment we conducted was aimed at developing a balanced reaching skill in a humanoid robot. The objective was to enable the robot to reach targets with its hand without losing balance. We used a small humanoid robot, the Fujitsu HOAP-II, for this experiment. The human operator controlled the robot's movements while maintaining stability."

### Slide 5: Balanced Reaching Skill Experiment - Method and Results
**Script:**
"In terms of methodology, the human operator used real-time motion capture to control the robot, with stability feedback provided through a visual interface. The results were promising, showing that the robot could maintain balance while reaching targets at low speeds. This success demonstrated the viability of using human sensorimotor learning for teaching robots statically stable reaching skills."

### Slide 6: Dynamic Posture Control Experiment - Objective and Setup
**Script:**
"The next experiment focused on dynamic posture control, specifically the ability to maintain the vertical balance of an inverted pendulum. We wanted to investigate the human ability to control dynamic tasks using different types of feedback. The setup included comparing visual feedback with proprioceptive-vestibular feedback using a Stewart platform."

### Slide 7: Dynamic Posture Control Experiment - Method and Results
**Script:**
"In this experiment, we compared the effectiveness of visual feedback alone versus combined visual and proprioceptive-vestibular feedback. The Stewart platform provided the proprioceptive-vestibular feedback, allowing the human operator to feel and respond to the robot's balance requirements naturally. The results showed that while visual feedback was sufficient for static tasks, proprioceptive-vestibular feedback significantly improved performance for dynamic tasks."

### Slide 8: Key Findings and Implications

"From these experiments, we derived several key findings. Firstly, the HL-RSS paradigm was effective for both static and dynamic tasks. This approach significantly reduces the need for expert programming, making it easier to develop complex robot skills. Additionally, the experiments highlighted the importance of multimodal feedback, particularly for dynamic tasks, where combining visual and proprioceptive-vestibular feedback provided superior performance."

### Slide 9: Future Directions
**Script:**
"Looking ahead, there are several exciting directions for future work. One area is expanding the HL-RSS paradigm to encompass more complex and varied tasks. Another focus is improving feedback interfaces to enhance both human learning and robot performance. By advancing these aspects, we can further simplify the development of autonomous robot behaviors and make advanced robotics more accessible."

### Slide 10: Conclusion
